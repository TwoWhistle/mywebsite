  <p style="font-family:verdana">11/20/24 12:21am Sorry this might get messy. Also I just fed Ramy pork. <br> ill preface this with the fact that I have a lot of respect for the guys at whoop and oura. They came to a realization/vision that I have a lot of respect for myself for having, so I respect them just as much for having the same vision.

But there comes a time when these companies stop innovating and start selling. <br>

Alright, looks like some of these metrics are pretty useful. <br>

Anyways, this rant was inspired by sleep debt. <br>

- im pretty sure sleep debt is false, and it’s something whoop and oura made up to get people hyper worrisome over their sleep and buy their products to track such sleep <br>
- a quick chat gpt tells me I’m mostly wrong. But, let’s not let facts get in the way of the truth: <br>
    - whoop and oura are taking advantage of peoples’ obsession with their health and have the potential to make it unhealthy. <br>

While I agree that most people who use these things actually have a pretty healthy relationship with their health (ie don’t have eating disorders and such), I think it may be possible to take a less traditional stance…

so here it is. I love getting faded and eating with the boys. My most memorable nights of college can’t happen without alcohol. And there’s nothing harder than ripping a cig while looking over a city skyline. These are the moments that make life worth living. But obviously you can’t do this all the time. 

So instead of making a technology tailored for the Bryan Johnsons of the world, it might be time to make a device for the balanced lifers - the noah rollettes of the world. (running and weed have come up together in a really weird way). 

Yeah, the autistic biohacker is maximizing his nighttime erections, but we’re here to enjoy life. Our forefathers worked so hard, getting alcohol legalized again, learning how to farm weed and tobacco, and refining sugar to its tastiest fructosey syrupy form. And these things will be with us, so lets learn how to enjoy them and not let them kill us, right? <br>
