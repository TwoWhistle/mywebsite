    9/20/24 2:00pm One reason the fda hasn't yet approved a drug for general longevity, is because there isn't yet a widely accepted metric for longevity (like Hba1c or body weight for diabetes). Let's take a shot at it. So there's no law of physics that says we can't live forever, but there are the fundamental laws of thermodynamics, which basically tell us that entropy in our body will continue to increase, ultimately resulting in death.

    8/28/24 10:28pm I was thinking about this phenomenon that for every semi-big groupchat there’s a bunch of smaller group chats with ~20% of the people in the big one and they control the background and once they reach a conclusion it gets published to the big groupchat. Anyways, how big does that first big groupchat have to be to have the break off ones - I’m guessing n=5. But it’s likely some function where as n increases, the probability/average number of breakoff groups increases exponentially, and then flattens out?
