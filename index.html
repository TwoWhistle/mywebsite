    2/1/25 4:22pm Everyone by now knows sleep is important. It's no longer considered biohacking to get your 8 hours. People need to start figuring out how to get the results of 8 hours in 4 hours. I’m starting a self experiment. To see what I can do to get the most out of sleeping less.

<br>- the goal is getting my body used to sleeping less. (6-7 hours) <br>
    - Because going to sleep at 1:30 and waking up at 8:30 is so fucking optimal<br>
- One key is physical activity - the correct dose<br>
    - I can’t be in like a heavy bulk or like some intense hybrid athlete shit.<br>
        - especially since this kind of recovery will require more deep non REM sleep, and I think I’m gonna want to prioritize REM for cognitive function.<br>
    - But I still have to be somehwat active. So I’ll have to do that periodic brisk walk thing and periodic bodyweight squats while working.<br>

This could work…<br>

the trick is to track how I’m feeling/thinking - I'd need a way to set a baseline and measure what it means to get the results of 8 hours.

    9/20/24 2:00pm One reason the fda hasn't yet approved a drug for general longevity, is because there isn't yet a widely accepted metric for longevity (like Hba1c or body weight for diabetes). Let's take a shot at it. So there's no law of physics that says we can't live forever, but there are the fundamental laws of thermodynamics, which basically tell us if we want to live forever we need an infinite supply of energy.

    8/28/24 10:28pm I was thinking about this phenomenon that for every semi-big groupchat there’s a bunch of smaller group chats with ~20% of the people in the big one and they control the background and once they reach a conclusion it gets published to the big groupchat. Anyways, how big does that first big groupchat have to be to have the break off ones - I’m guessing n=5. But it’s likely some function where as n increases, the probability/average number of breakoff groups increases exponentially, and then flattens out?
