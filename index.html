    11/20/24 12:525pm The farthest future I can think of right now for diagnostics is continuous in vivo RNAseq for every cell in your body. I've only thought about it for a couple minutes, but I don't think it gets more advanced than that. Maybe there's something more advanced you can do with the DNA itself, but I think RNAseq is more effective because it includes expression. Obvisouly you can continue to innovate on the ways you analyze this data, and you can also continue innovating on RNAseq until maybe it isn't called RNA seq anymore, but the technology would sitll be based around the exposome.

    9/20/24 2:00pm The fda can't approave a drug for general longevity because there isn't yet a widely accepted metric for longevity (like Hba1c or body weight for diabetes). But this implies there's a mechanism behind actually extending life, as opposed to delaying the onset of disease->death

    8/28/24 10:28pm I was thinking about this phenomenon that for every semi-big groupchat there’s a bunch of smaller group chats with ~20% of the people in the big one and they control the background and once they reach a conclusion it gets published to the big groupchat. Anyways, how big does that first big groupchat have to be to have the break off ones - I’m guessing n=5. But it’s likely some function where as n increases, the probability/average number of breakoff groups increases exponentially, and then flattens out?
