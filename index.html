    2/5/25 11:33am Im pretty sure if guys like socrates, plato, aristotle lived today, they'd be retired tech entrepreneurs that made money during the dotcom boom, started a VC, and now write essays for their blogs/rants on twitter. The fact that Thales, one of the first documented philosophers and the father of western philosophy used his astronomy knowledge to make <a href="https://thehistorianshut.com/2020/05/06/thales-of-miletus-and-his-olive-press-monopoly/">bets on olive oil futures</a> should be convincing enough. Guys like naval, paul graham, peter thiel really have been moving like philosophers lately. There's so many parrallels: socrates corrupting the youth and peter thiel telling kids to drop out, plato's republic and elon's technocracy, idk there's probably better examples.

    2/4/25 7:33pm Its already becoming somewhat clear that the next gen of wearable devices is implantable devices. Im unsure if I should keep fucking around with wearables or just go straight to implantables

    2/3/25 5:37pm I always thought that life's mechanisms are in a constant fight against entropy, and that entropy eventually accumulates faster than an organism can export it. I always thought that this entropy accumulation was manifested in things like DNA mutations, but I realized the thermodynamic implications of the correct DNA sequence vs a point mutation are the same.

    2/1/25 4:32pm The fact that the trendy healthy diet went from being vegan to being a carnivore is so funny. Something something about the rise of male influencers

    11/20/24 12:525pm The farthest future I can think of right now for diagnostics is continuous in vivo RNAseq for every cell in your body. I've only thought about it for a couple minutes, but I don't think it gets more advanced than that. Maybe there's something more advanced you can do with the DNA itself, but I think RNAseq is more effective because it includes expression. Obvisouly you can continue to innovate on the ways you analyze this data, and you can also continue innovating on RNAseq until maybe it isn't called RNA seq anymore, but the technology would sitll be based around the exposome.

    9/20/24 2:00pm The fda can't approave a drug for general longevity because there isn't yet a widely accepted metric for longevity (like Hba1c or body weight for diabetes). But this implies there's a mechanism behind actually extending life, as opposed to delaying the onset of disease->death

    8/28/24 10:28pm I was thinking about this phenomenon that for every semi-big groupchat there’s a bunch of smaller group chats with ~20% of the people in the big one and they control the background and once they reach a conclusion it gets published to the big groupchat. Anyways, how big does that first big groupchat have to be to have the break off ones - I’m guessing n=5. But it’s likely some function where as n increases, the probability/average number of breakoff groups increases exponentially, and then flattens out?
